# AvaloniaUI Enhanced BottomNavigationBar with Page Navigation
### Introduction
This project is an extended version of the [BottomNavigationBar](https://github.com/lukewire129/AvaloniaNavigationBar) implemented using AvaloniaUI. In this version, we have added page navigation capabilities to the existing bottom navigation bar, allowing users to navigate through the application more efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Page Navigation Capabilities**: Seamlessly transition to associated pages when a user selects an item from the bottom navigation bar.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The page transitions are smooth and intuitive, greatly improving user interaction.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Developers can easily add or modify pages and navigation bar items as needed.

### How It Works
#### Page Transition Mechanism
This project uses the ListBox control to manage pages linked to each navigation bar item. When a user selects an item, the corresponding page is activated and displayed.

### Customization and Styling
The styling of pages and the navigation bar can be customized using AvaloniaUIâ€™s styling system, maintaining consistency with the overall design of the application.

### Getting Started
